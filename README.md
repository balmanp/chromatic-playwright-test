# Chromatic for Playwright

This repository showcases a demo of integrating Chromatic with Playwright for visual regression testing.

## Introduction

Chromatic is a visual testing tool that works seamlessly with Storybook to capture UI snapshots and compare them over time. Playwright is an end-to-end testing framework that can automate browser interactions. By integrating Chromatic with Playwright, this setup enables comprehensive visual regression testing alongside functional tests, ensuring UI components render correctly and behave as expected across different states.

## Demo

This repository demonstrates how to:

- **Start Storybook**: Launch Storybook to visualize UI components.
- **Run Chromatic**: Capture and compare visual snapshots of Storybook components.
- **Execute Playwright Tests**: Perform end-to-end tests, including visual regression checks.

Chromatic will provide detailed reports of any visual differences detected, allowing for easy review and approval of UI changes directly in the Chromatic UI.
